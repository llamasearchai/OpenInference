# Contributing to OpenInference

First off, thank you for considering contributing to OpenInference! We welcome any help to make this project better.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into OpenInference itself.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/llamasearchai/OpenInference/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/llamasearchai/OpenInference/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement, feel free to open an issue. Please provide a clear description of the enhancement and its potential benefits.

### Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, new features, and improvements.

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes (`python -m unittest discover -s tests`).
5.  Make sure your code lints (details on linting tools to be added).
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

(TODO: Add details on code style, e.g., Black, isort, and any specific conventions.)

## Code of Conduct

(TODO: Consider adding a Code of Conduct if the project grows and attracts more contributors. For now, we expect respectful and constructive interactions.)

## Any questions?

Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or need clarification on how to contribute.

Thank you for your interest in OpenInference!
